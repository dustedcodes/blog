            <p>Hi, welcome to my personal website, software development blog and the official home of <strong>Dusted Codes Limited</strong>, a UK registered company. I'm Dustin, a software engineer, entrepreneur and open source contributor who's originally from Vienna, Austria but living in the UK now.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my career I have had the pleasure of working with a wide range of technologies for companies of all sizes. I have mainly worked in agile environments, following <a href="https://dusted.codes/when-to-use-scrum-waterfall-vs-scrum-vs-kanban-vs-scrumban">Scrum or Kanban</a> methodologies. I have experience with continuous integration and deployment, and I have run mission-critical production systems in major cloud providers like AWS, Google, and Azure.</p>

    <p>In one of my past roles, I led and managed a team of highly skilled engineers who built large-scale Facebook games for one of Europe's biggest gaming companies. These experiences taught me a great deal about working efficiently with teams, collaborating productively with stakeholders, and delivering projects that meet the needs of customers and users.</p>

    <p>After 10 years in the corporate world, I decided to take a break and travel the world with my wife. We had some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dustedtravels/" target="_blank">amazing experiences</a> and I learned a lot about myself. When we came back to the UK, I set up my own business so I could work on the things which I'm most passionate about. I now maintain several <a href="/open-source">open source projects</a> in my spare time, take <a href="/hire">contract roles</a> from time to time whilst trying to build my own startup from the ground up.</p>

    <p>Besides coding I love playing competitive sports such as tennis and basketball or go on a relaxing surf vacation. I am also a huge fan of British stand-up comedy and into fine dining.</p>
