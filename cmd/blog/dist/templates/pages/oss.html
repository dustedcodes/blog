            <p>Giraffe is an F# micro web framework for building rich web applications. It has been heavily inspired and is similar to <a href="https://suave.io/" target="_blank">Suave</a>, but has been specifically designed with <a href="https://www.asp.net/core" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core</a> in mind and can be plugged into the ASP.NET Core pipeline via middleware. Giraffe applications are composed by so called HttpHandler functions which can be thought of a lighter and more functional form of ASP.NET Core's middleware.</p>
            <p class="mt-5">It has been <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Giraffe" target="_blank">installed more than 1.2 million times</a>, has <a href="https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe" target="_blank">more than 1800 GitHub stars</a> and has been <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/scenarios/web-development" target="_blank">featured as a recommended F# web framework by Microsoft</a>.</p>

            <p>Self Destruct Notes is a tiny web service written in Go which allows the secure sharing of secrets in a corporate environment. Instead of sharing sensitive information like user credentials or a user's PII directly in internal chats one can use this web service to create a unique one-time note that will automatically destroy after being read. This has the benefit that secret or sensitive data doesn't preserve in the history of a chat. Self-destruct-notes is an open source project which organisations must self host in their corporate environment.</p>
