# .NET peaked, Time to Go

I debated for months whether to write this blog post or not. I started several drafts but always decided against it, until now. My thoughts have finally solidified, giving me the clarity which I needed to put my thoughts into words. Today, I’m confident in my assessment and able to express my feelings in complete lines of thought. I know what I am about to say will be hugely controversial and probably spark a minor backlash, but at the end of the day this is my blog and my space where I can freely express my own opinions, and unfortunately this is just how I feel.

So here it is: **I’m done with .NET.** Not professionally, but emotionally. I no longer enjoy it. I don’t care much anymore beyond what I need to know for contractual work. I no longer choose .NET for new projects, and I don’t advise teams to use it when I’m asked for an opinion. I know I’m not alone who feels that way. I’ve seen countless .NET-heavy organisations which have slowly been shifting to other languages too. The appeal of .NET is fading, and it’s fading fast.

This might be controversial because many believe .NET is at its peak, and to some extent, I agree. But in my view, .NET __has already peaked__. I’d argue it reached its zenith at versions 6 or 7 and has declined since. C# is evolving into something unrecognisable and increasingly unpleasant to work with. Tooling and IDE support were more diverse a few years ago than they are today. We’ve lost Xamarin, OmniSharp, and Visual Studio for Mac in just a short span of time. F# is being entirely consumed by C#, and the .NET community’s attitude towards F# feels increasingly more hostile too. A few years ago, .NET developers were simply unaware of F# and its capabilities. Today, it seems C# developers actively dismiss F# as something completely useless without even understanding what a functional language truly is. They don’t just dismiss F#, the community **proudly** ignores F#, mirroring Microsoft’s own direction and lack of support.

What I dislike the most about .NET though is the tight grip which Microsoft holds over the community. Microsoft has a stranglehold around .NET and they are actively pulling .NET developers away from the rest of the open source community in order to keep them close to Windows, Visual Studio and Azure. They don’t actively prevent one from using .NET with other software, but they are successfully pushing large swaths of the .NET developers towards their closed software that it makes you feel lonely. For every GitHub star that a .NET project has for an OSS integration you will find 500 GitHub stars for the proprietary Azure equivalent. For every organisation that uses .NET on AWS you will find 1000 organisations that use .NET on Azure. I am not suggesting that there is no diversity in .NET, but the technological diversity in the .NET community is resembling the racial diversity of a Hollywood movie in the 80s. There are a few background people and the bloke that got shot in scene 1, and the rest is the same.

Let me get one thing straight, I’m not here to write a “shock-factor” article. This is my very raw and unfiltered opinion on how I really feel today and if you’re not into reading those strong opinion pieces then you might as well stop here because it won’t get better. I am done with .NET and I’m about to delve into the details to explain why I feel this way.
